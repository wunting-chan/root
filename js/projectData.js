Individual users who discuss sensitive issues online may find their social media posts are made invisible or removed and may even have their accounts shut down.\n\nIn this literature, we propound steganography as a publishing infrastructure against internet keyword censorship. We conducted an experiment to confirm our hypothesis that steganography is a viable way to transmit sensitive information over censored networks. The end product is a publicly available, online steganography tool equipped with an improved version of an existing steganographic algorithm that uses random pixel selection to minimize noise in the stego image. We evaluated the proposed method against its predecessors and found that our method gives a higher quality of stego images in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and other common metrics used to measure image steganographic systems.'

It is at first just a mirror-ing algorithm, modeled after the real ELIZA, the first chat bot ever existed created by researchers at MIT in the 60s. The entity then slowly evolves into a modern day LLM as visitors interacts with it in deeper and deeper ways. Eventually, I hope to support this site with heftier compute on the backend so that I can create a deepfaked persona of the current user so they can have a conversation with themselves.'

As an artist, I have always seen art as something that cannot be confined inside exhibits, galleries, and museums. To a lot of people who make art, art exists in the process of making. We make communities in the process of making art. For me, the most fulfilling moments when I make art is when I see people coming together and socialize in the backdrop of an art show. Art should be a platform where unlikely strangers meet and discuss topics meaningful to them.\n\nWhen I got wind of the massive protests against an extradition law being proposed in Hong Kong, I knew I needed to contribute in some way. Using the translation of the Temporary Autonomous Zone as the center piece, I wanted to create a platform that enables discussions and exploration of new political perspectives. At the end, I ended up with a project which lies in the intersection of art, translation, and civic action. It was a precious opportunity to experience the power of a community, and the tenacity mutual aid provides to a political movement.\n\nThis project owes its success to the 40+ enthusiastic volunteers who contributed time and energy to various tasks, including translation reviews, footnote reviews, translation iterations, distribution location scouts, digital messengering, transportation of cargos, and distribution of books. While this project never had a fixed project team, the fluidity of the team\'s dynamic and the wide set of talent were instrumental to the realization of what would have diminished into a fleeting thought without their contribution.'

In InFlux the performer\u2019s body becomes a site of inquiry into the collapsing divide between subject and object, a body continuously processed, abstracted, and consumed by systems designed to extract value from every data point.\n\n' +

The audience witnesses Danny\u2019s corporeal form morph in tandem with its digital double, experiencing firsthand how neural networks can hallucinate new bodies from mere pixels. The emoji, typically a flattening shorthand of human expression, becomes here a fractured surrogate, an iconography that paradoxically reveals the loss of embodied presence.\n\n' +
        'The technological core of the piece utilizes an R-CNN architecture to isolate Danny\u2019s figure in each video frame, employing graph-based methods such as GrabCut for foreground extraction. From there, each block of pixels is programmatically matched to an emoji that most closely aligns in form and color, producing a mosaic in constant flux. The neural network is trained not for classification accuracy but to explore the fuzzy, stochastic boundaries of visual resemblance, embracing the brittle misclassifications and the system\u2019s own blind spots. This deliberate misuse of machine learning frameworks allows the work to destabilize typical discriminations of body, object, and meaning.\n\n' +

The system, while technically sophisticated, is intentionally fragile, intended to be a nod to the brittleness of the infrastructures that underpin our increasingly digitized interactions.'
